# Version history

!!! info "Semantics"
    Version numbering aims to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Therefore:

      * New patch versions (e.g. 1.1.**0** to 1.1.**1**) make minor changes that do not alter fuctionality or calculated results.
      * New minor versions (e.g. 1.**0**.1 to 1.**1**.0) add new functionality, but will not break your code. They will not alter the results of calculations with default settings.
      * New major versions (e.g. **1**.1.1 to **2**.0.0) may break your code and require you to rewrite things. They may alter the results of calculations with default settings.


!!! warning
    *Will (not) break your code* refers **only** to how you use the main `CO2SYS` function as imported with:
    ```python
    from PyCO2SYS import CO2SYS
    ```
    However, the structure of the underlying modules and their functions is not yet stable and, for now, may change in any version increment. Such changes will be described in the release notes below.

## 1.2

Adds additional buffer factor calculations that are not currently included in CO<sub>2</sub>SYS for MATLAB. New releases are henceforth assigned DOIs from Zenodo.

### 1.2.1 (9 Apr 2020)

!!! example "Changes in v1.2.1"
    * Fixed typo in [ESM10](../refs/#ESM10) equations that had been carried through into `extra.buffers_ESM10` function (thanks [Jim Orr](https://twitter.com/James1Orr/status/1248216403355803648)!).

### 1.2.0 (8 Apr 2020)

!!! example "Changes in v1.2.0"
    * Added module `extra` containing functions to calculate variables not included in CO2SYS for MATLAB:
      * `buffers_ESM10` calculates the buffer factors of [ESM10](../refs/#ESM10), corrected for the typos noted by [RAH18](../refs/#RAH18).
      * `bgc_isocap` calculates the "exact" isocapnic quotient of [HDW18](../refs/#HDW18), Eq. 8.
      * `bgc_isocap_approx` calculates the approximate isocapnic quotient of [HDW18](../refs/#HDW18), Eq. 7.
      * `psi` calculates the $\psi$ factor of [FCG94](../refs/#FCG94).
    * Added all functions in `extra` to the `CO2dict` output of the main `CO2SYS` function, and documented in the [Github repo README](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS#pyco2sys).

## 1.1

Adds extra optional inputs for consistency with Pierrot et al.'s forthcoming MATLAB "v1.21". Continues to reorganise subfunctions into more Pythonic modules, while avoiding changing the actual mechanics of calculations.

### 1.1.1 (20 Mar 2020)

!!! example "Changes in v1.1.1"
    * Removed unnecessary `WhoseTB` input to `assemble.equilibria`.

### 1.1.0 (19 Mar 2020)

!!! example "Changes in v1.1.0"
    * Updated pH-solving iterative functions so that iteration stops separately for each row once it reaches the tolerance threshold.
    * Extracted all functions for solving the CO<sub>2</sub> system into a separate module (`solve`).
    * Extracted other key subfunctions into module `assemble`.
    * Added total ammonium (`NH3`) and hydrogen sulfide (`H2S`) concentrations as optional inputs to be included in the alkalinity model.
    * Added optional input to choose between different equations for hydrogen fluoride dissociation constant (`KFCONSTANT`).
    * Added functions to enable carbonate ion as an input carbonate system variable.
    * Output is now only the `CO2dict` dict, not the original `DATA`, `HEADERS` and `NICEHEADERS`.
    * Eliminated all global variables throughout the entire program.

## 1.0

### 1.0.1 (28 Feb 2020)

Starts to make things more Pythonic.

!!! example "Changes in v1.0.1"
      * Extracted all equations for concentrations and equilibrium constants into functions in separate modules (`concentrations` and `equilibria`).
      * Eliminated all global variables from the `_Constants` function.
      * Moved the as-close-as-possible version into module `original`. The default `from PyCO2SYS import CO2SYS` now imports the more Pythonic implementation.

### 1.0.0 (3 Feb 2020)

An as-close-as-possible clone of [MATLAB CO2SYS v2.0.5](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB).

!!! example "Release notes for v1.0.0"
      * The first output `DICT` is new: a dict containing a separate entry for each variable in the original output `DATA`, with the keys named following the original output `HEADERS`.
      * The output `DATA` is transposed relative to the MATLAB version because Numpy is row-major while MATLAB is column-major.
      * Every combination of input options was tested against the MATLAB version with no significant differences (i.e. all differences can be attributed to floating point errors).
